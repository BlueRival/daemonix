daemonix
========

Daemonix is a tool for deploying and managing NodeJS systems as a daemon in Linux/Unix environments.

Were are targeting Ubuntu 12.04+ for our initial release but other distros will come online eventually. No, we will never try to make this work for Windows in any way shape or form.

Pronunciation: day-mon-icks
